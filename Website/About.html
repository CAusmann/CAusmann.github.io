          In 2020, Queen-B Security was awarded the North America Cyber Security Excellence Award. "But how did you get this far?" you may be asking. Well, we're glad you asked. Bella Lestrange graduated from Dakota State University with a Masters in Computer Science in 2015, and quickly started working on Queen-B Security. Her mission was to create a security company built and run by women. Since then, Bella has hired female employees from all over the globe to help her make this dream a reality. Our mission is to become the most trusted security software provider in the industry and supply the world with safety.
